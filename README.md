# DHCP  
This projetct is the third project of Computer Networks course at AUT. It has two parts. First we should answer to some questions related to the project and then implement Ir according to the [project explanation.](https://github.com/Mahdi-Rahmani/DHCP-Client-Server/blob/main/Project%20Explanation/CN-P-3.pdf)

 3. Explain how to exchange messages in the DHCP protocol with a diagram and fully explain each step.
